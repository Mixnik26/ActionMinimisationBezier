# Action minimisation using Bezier curves

In this project I (attempt) to solve the Euler-Lagrange equations by finding the path that minimises a given action from a Lagrangian using a variational method. The key idea here is a to approximate the solution as an $n$-th degree Bezier curve and choose control points that minimise the action along that curve. As $n$ increases, the Bezier curve seems to converge to the true solution. I eventually want to implement this into a general Euler-Lagrange solver that can also handle IVP physics problems, which is why I choose the Lagrangian as an argument instead of the action.
Action computation and minimisation is handled by scipy's `integrate.quad` and `optimize.minimize`. I find that sometimes `optimize.minimize` struggles to reach a suitable tolerance for larger Bezier degree (roughly $n$~5 for the Brachistochrone example), and `integrate.quad` struggles to reach a suitable tolerance for some boundary conditions. In spite of this, I seem to be getting roughly 4th order convergence and sometimes even 5th order convergence, however this is purely empirical and I have yet to prove generality.
